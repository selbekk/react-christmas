When I work on large applications, I often stumble across usecases where a
simple component just isn't enough. These pieces of UI tend to be the ones that
are reusable, flexible to fit a ton of usecases, and end up with a
multiple-digit number of properties.

My favorite example of this kind of component is a card component. It can
contain images, text, titles, lists, icons - you name it!

Here's an example of a typical, flexible component that's hard to use:

```js
<Card
  image="/static/images/happy-people.png"
  imagePosition="top"
  href="/favorite"
  text="The most watched movies, available in a heart beat."
  title="My favorites"
  type="primary"
/>
```

Tons of props, and it doesn't scale too well. What can we do?

## Use `children`

The first enhancement we can do, is to place the most dominant piece of the
content in the `children` prop - so that we at least feel like we're
encapsulating our content in some sort of wrapper.

```js
<Card
  image="/static/images/happy-people.png"
  imagePosition="top"
  href="/favorite"
  title="My favorites"
  type="primary"
>
  The <strong>most watched</strong> movies, available in a ‚ù§Ô∏è beat.
</Card>
```

An added bonus is that using JSX feels more intuitive, too!

This, however, isn't enough. We still lack the flexibility we need to get rid of
the rest of our pesky props! Time to do something drastic.

## Creating sub-components

A typical approach when you find youself in such a situation, is to create what
I call "sub-components". These components don't make much sense on their own,
but they make up the individual parts of a larger component.

Our `Card` component, for instance, could be implemented like this:

```js
const Card = props => (
  <CardWrapper type={props.type} href={props.href}>
    {props.imagePosition === 'top' && <CardImage src={props.image} />}
    <CardTitle>{props.title}</CardTitle>
    <CardContent>{props.children}</CardContent>
    {props.imagePosition === 'bottom' && <CardImage src={props.image} />}
  </CardWrapper>
);
```

If we just disclosed these sub-components somehow, and just let the consumer
decide which order they should come in (and what props they should receive), we
would be more flexible than a bungee cord.

Our component could then be used like this:

```js
<Card href="/favorites" type="primary">
  <CardImage src="/static/images/happy-people.png" alt="Happy people" />
  <CardTitle>My favorites</CardTitle>
  <CardContent>
    The <strong>most watched</strong> movies, available in a ‚ù§Ô∏è beat.
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

That's pretty easy to arrange a ton of ways, right?

## How to make these sub-components available to the consumer?

So we now have a main component, and a few sub-components. How do we expose our
API to the consumers? The way I see it, we have 4 alternatives

### Alternative 1: Default + named exports

Our first alternative is to expose the main component as the default export, and
any sub-components as named exports. You'd use them like this:

```js
import Card, { CardImage, CardTitle, CardContent } from 'components/card';
```

This works fine, but there's a few downsides too. You have to remember that
there's both default and named exports, and you (most likely) need to prefix
every component with the main component's name, in order not to litter the
file-global namespace with imports. Still, it works just fine!

### Alternative 2: Totally separate components

Keeping the sub-components as totally separate components might also seem like a
good idea, but beware of other people using these components outside of their
intended context too. There's little to no connection between your main and
sub-components this way. Also - you'll get a ton of import lines!

```js
import Card from 'components/card';
import CardImage from 'components/card-image';
import CardTitle from 'components/card-title';
import CardContent from 'components/card-content';
```

### Alternative 3: Default export + components as static props

A pretty popular way to solve this is by only exporting the main component, and
then exposing any sub-components as static properties on it. You use it like
this:

```js
<Card href="/favorites" type="primary">
  <Card.Image src="/static/images/happy-people.png" alt="Happy people" />
  <Card.Title>My favorites</Card.Title>
  <Card.Content>
    The <strong>most watched</strong> movies, available in a ‚ù§Ô∏è beat.
  </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

This is the way I've been doing this for a while. Yep, you still need to
remember that the properties are there (just like alternative 1), but static
code analysis tools can help out. In addition, you don't have to think about
littering the global namespace with imports!

### Alternative 4: Render props

A last alternative, and my favorite right now, is using the render props pattern
to expose the available sub-components. The usage would look like this:

```js
<Card href="/favorites" type="primary">
  {({ Image, Title, Content }) => (
    <Image src="/static/images/happy-people.png" alt="Happy people" />
    <Title>My favorites</Title>
    <Content>
      The <strong>most watched</strong> movies, available in a ‚ù§Ô∏è beat.
    </Content>
  )}
</Card>
```

This alternative has two very distinct upsides.

Firstly, we can skip the prefix and namespacing, since the sub-components only
are available in the scope of the `children` function.

Secondly, we can make our components smarter! Based on the different props
passed to the main component, we can expose different sub-components too - in
addition to any extra flags or functionality we want.

The only downside I can think of is the syntax itself - if you're bothered by
that kind of thing, of course üòâ

## Go split up your components!

No matter what you decide, I hope you try to split up your mega-chunks of UI
into composable, flexible components with a few props each.
