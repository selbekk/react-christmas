From time to time, you create a React component as a function since state is not
necessary at that point. In the end, you catch yourself converting your function
into an ES6 class anyway. Unfortunately, classes often tend to become complex
and make code reuse difficult. Thanks to a new feature proposal called _Hooks_
this may become a matter of the past sooner than you think!

At the time of writing, React Hooks are only available in React 16.7 alpha. They
aren't introducing any breaking changes and can easily be used side by side with
stateful logic that you have implemented at other places in your application
(you just can't use Hooks in ES6 classes). The feature proposal introduces
several different types of Hooks (you can even [build your own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)). This article focuses on two of
those: **State Hooks** and **Effect Hooks**.

## State Hook

Before hooks were introduced, an app that would help Santa keep track of how
many gifts he delivered would probably have looked like this:

```javascript
class SantaApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      giftCount: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Ho ho ho! You have delivered {giftCount} gift(s).</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.setState({
              giftCount: this.state.giftCount + 1
            })
          }
        >
          Gift delivered
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We have an initial state `{ giftCount: 0 }` which can be changed by Santa
pressing a button that calls `this.setState()`. When we want to display the gift
count, we use `this.state.giftCount`.

Using a State Hook, the result becomes a lot more compact:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function SantaApp() {
  const [giftCount, setGiftCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Ho ho ho! You have delivered {giftCount} gifts.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setGiftCount(giftCount + 1)}>
        Gift delivered
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

First, we have to import the _useState_ Hook. Then, the initial number of gifts
(which is zero) is passed to the Hook as a parameter. useState returns an array
containing the current state (which we called `giftCount` in this example) and a
function (`setGiftCount`) which triggers a re-render of the component and
updates the state. In addition to numbers, State Hooks work fine with strings,
booleans or objects as well. You can even define multiple Hooks in a single
component:

```javascript
const [giftsDelivered, setGiftsDelivered] = useState(false);
const [nextGift, setNextGift] = useState([
  { title: 'Learn about React Hooks', type: 'book' }
]);
```

### Why 'this' isn't so hard anymore

If you've read the [third article of this Advent
calendar](https://react.christmas/2018/3), you may recall that binding `this`
can be troublesome and that you probably have forgotten it several times. Since
there is no `this` in function components (functions don't have
instances), we don't need to worry about it when using Hooks. Isn't that
awesome?!

## Effect Hook

While State Hooks let you use stateful logic in function components, the Effect
Hook makes it possible to perform side effects (such as fetching data from a
server, changing the DOM, etc.). By default it runs after every render (both
after the first render and after every update) and can therefore be used to
replace the lifecycle methods _componendDidMount_ and _componentDidUpdate_.

We can now extend our app to fetch the next gift to be delivered on every
re-render (e.g. when `giftCount` changes):

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function SantaApp() {
  const [giftCount, setGiftCount] = useState(0);
  const [nextGift, setNextGift] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.santaapp.no/nextGift')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setNextGift(data);
      });
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Ho ho ho! You have delivered {giftCount} gifts.</p>
      {nextGift.map(({ title, type }) => (
        <p key={title}>
          The next gift to be delivered is the {type} "{title}".
        </p>
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => setGiftCount(giftCount + 1)}>
        Gift delivered
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, we imported _useEffect_ and added the Hook to our component
which fetches information about the next gift and stores the value using a newly
added State Hook.

### Skipping Effects

Sometimes you don't want to trigger your Effect Hook on **every re-render**.
This can be achieved by passing an array as a second argument to useEffect.
Passing an empty array will only run the effect when your component is mounted
and unmounted. If you pass an array containing some values, the effect is
skipped as long as these values aren't changing.

```javascript
useEffect(
  () => {
    // only re-run if giftCount changes
  },
  [giftCount]
);
```

## How to continue from here?

Hooks are experimental and their implementation might change in the future.
Therefore, you should wait to use them in any critical projects. Until then, you
can try Hooks [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/3ywv7n5lxp), or start using them
in your hobby project. Hope you got hooked on Hooks!
