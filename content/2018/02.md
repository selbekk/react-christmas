# Why is this so hard?

To better understand why we need to bind `this` in React, we should understand how `this` [works in JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md). Let's take a shot at it with the following snippet. 

```javascript
class Santa() {
  constructor() {
    this.catchphrase = "Ho ho ho ho!";
  }
  
  greet() {
    return this.catchphrase;
  }
}

const santa = new Santa();
console.log(santa.greet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
```

Awesome! That worked as expected, but will this?

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const greet = santa.greet;
console.log(greet()); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'catchphrase' of undefined

```

Wait, what!? We got a `TypeError` saying `catchphrase` isn't a property of `undefined`. Why is that?

In JavaScript, `this` is determined when a function is called, not when the function is defined. Moreover, `this` refers to the context of the function.

In the above example we create a new variable `greet`. `greet` is a top level variable so its context is `undefined`, and `undefined` does not have a property named `catchphrase`. Unlike `santa.greet` which has `santa` as its context, due to implicit binding. 

To better understand implicit binding, consider this example. 

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const greet = santa.greet;

const sheldon {
  catchphrase: "Bazinga!"
}

sheldon.greet = greet;
console.log(sheldon.greet()); // Bazinga!
```

Bazinga! This works because the `greet` function is called in the context of `sheldon`, which has a property named `catchphrase`.

## Binding it ourselves

Sometimes we might want to specify the context of a function. This can be achieved with the `bind` function, and is called explicit binding. 

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const badGreet = santa.greet;

const goodGreet = badGreet.bind(santa);
console.log(goodGreet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
console.log(badGreet()); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'catchphrase' of undefined
```

Calling `bind` on a function returns a copy of the funciton with the argument as the context. In other words `this` is always whatever argument you pass to `bind` for that function. This even works if the implicit context is changed.

```javascript
sheldon.greet = goodGreet;
console.log(sheldon.greet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
```

## What about React?

Let's transform our example into a React component.

```jsx
class Santa extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {
      catchphrase: "Ho ho ho ho!"
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button 
        onClick={this.sayCatchphrase}
      >
        Say catchphrase
      </button>
    );
  }
  
  sayCatchphrase() {
    console.log(this.state.catchphrase);
  }
}
```

Clicking the button should ideally print `Ho ho ho ho!` to the console. However, it does **not** in the above example.

In the `sayCatchphrase` function `this` would be `undefined`. This is because the event handler function loses its implicitl binding. As mentioned previously, the context is determined when the function is called. When the event occurs and the function is invoked, the context falls back to the default binding and is set to `undefined`. 

To fix this we have a couple of options. We could bind the function ourselves: 

```jsx
<button 
  onClick={this.sayCatchphrase.bind(this)}
>
  Say catchphrase
</button>

```

> It is considered best practice to [avoid binding your functions in the render method.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-arrow-functions-and-bind-in-reacts-render-are-problematic-f1c08b060e36)


We can use an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). This works because `this` is bound [lexically](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#lexical-this). This means that it uses the context of the `render` method as its context.

```jsx
<button 
  onClick={() => this.sayCatchphrase()}
>
  Say catchphrase
</button>
```

Or we can use the [public class field syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties), which is still experimental and a babel plugin is required to use it. 


```jsx
class Santa extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {
      catchphrase: "Ho ho ho ho!"
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button 
        onClick={this.sayCatchphrase}
      >
        Say catchphrase
      </button>
    );
  }
  
  sayCatchphrase = () => {
    console.log(this.state.catchphrase);
  }
}
```

That's it!
