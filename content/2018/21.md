I love React Native. Sure, it has its flaws, but it's the most fun I've had developing. This short write up is a short introduction on how to make the most out of your animations with `useNativeDriver`. Animation in React Native is fairly straightforward. Normally, you'd be using the `Animated` API included in React Native. 

You should know that there are alternatives. Like Reanimated from [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo), which extends Animated. And then there's [Lottie](https://github.com/react-native-community/lottie-react-native), [Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/) and a bunch more exciting things. But lets get back on topic.

## How to use it?
As you might know, most of the stuff going on in React Native occurs on the JS thread. While this works most of the time we want to make sure performance is as good as possible. That's when you add `useNativeDriver` to your component's attributes, making your animations run on the UI thread instead of the JS thread. It really is as easy as that.

Although there are some caveats. For instance, you can only use it while animating on non-layout properties. So `transforms` and `opacity` are fine, while `position` and flexbox properties aren't.

## Unsure whether or not you have a problem?
Running animations on the JS thread can be perfectly fine. I tend to use `useNativeDriver` whenever I can. But you certainly don't have to. An easy way to determine if you might have a problem is to bring up the developer menu in your simulator. Just press `CMD + D` for iOS or `control + M` for Android. 

If you select the `Show perf monitor` option, you'll see this in your window:

If you click about your app now you'll see the frames per second while interacting. If you see the JS thread dropping frames you are doing too heavy lifting here, something that `useNativeDriver` might help you to solve.
