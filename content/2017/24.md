I have been trying to learn as much as possible about React for the last couple of years. It's an amazing technology
and all - but what's driven me to really dive into the nitty gritty of it is the amazing people of this community.
Whether you find your social fix on Reddit, Twitter, Reactiflux or Stack Overflow, there are incredibly driven people
that just keeps on giving. Thank you <3

This post will not be long - it's the day before Christmas, and I'd rather spend my evening with fiancèe and Burger
than typing on a sticky MacBook. Instead, I want to leave you with a list of great resources to keep your React
learning spree going - long after this Christmas calendar stunt is over.

Some of the links will be Twitter accounts. Follow these incredibly talented people! Interact with them, thank them and
appreciate their work and never-ending efforts to share.

Other links will be links to great learning resources. Some share great blog posts, other like to make videos.

## Some parting words

Thank you for following along these last 24 days. It started out as a learning resource for my colleagues, but at the
time of writing, over 16 000 people have visited. I've hugely appreciated every single thank you, retweet, upvote and
pull request (to fix my lousy spelling) - and I just wanted to take this opportunity to sincerely say thank you! May your
stockings be filled with lots of candy and good stuff.

If you haven't read all the articles, click through them and read the ones that look interesting to you. I'll make
this "blog" more blog-like sometime soon, so it'll be easier to navigate.

These have been my first blog posts in ~ 4 years, but I'm sure they won't be my last. Follow me on
[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/selbekk) if you want a heads up about the next one!

So that's it! Enjoy the links - and have a very merry Christmas!
